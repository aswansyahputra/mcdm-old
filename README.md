# **MCDM**
The purpose of this application is to conduct Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). Under the hood, this app has R language as the 'engine' for calculation and analysis. This shiny app is the implementation of MCDM package by Blanca A. Ceballos Martin.

Currently, the supported methods are as follow:

* Multi-Objetive Optimization by Ration Analysis (MOORA) and the "Full Multiplicative Form" (Multi-MOORA).
* Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) Method with the linear transformation of maximum as normalization prodecure.
* Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) Method with the vectorial normalization prodecure.
* *"VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje"* (VIKOR) Method.
* Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) Method.
* Meta Ranking of rankings obtained from MMOORA, TOPSIS, VIKOR, and WASPAS methods. Two meta ranking are proposed, i.e. sum of rankings and aggregated rankings.
